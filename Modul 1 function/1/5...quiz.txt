1..why do we need to import React from "react" in our files
 ans...because the jsx syntax is defined in react 


2.If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
  If it's a JSX content ...returns js object
  A javascripte object . React elements that describe what React 
   should eventually add to the real DOM for us 


3.What is wrong with this code:
   const page = (
     <h1>hey</h1>
     <p>this is col</p>  )

  Two sibling elements .. All JSX element should be in a parent element

NB...sometimes we use fragments as parents...  const page = (
<>    
     <h1>hey</h1>
     <p>this is col</p> 
</>
 )



4 .What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"
   Declarative:Tell computer what to do and it works out the details


5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
   we have small peices that we can put together to make something larger/greater than the individual pieces
