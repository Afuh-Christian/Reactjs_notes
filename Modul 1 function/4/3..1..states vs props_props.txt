In React ....

values created within the functions are usally handled with 
state 


1..Describ state ....
  -they way things currently are
  -a way for react to remember saved values from within a component.
   this is similar to declaring variables from within a component,
    with a few addend bonuses (later)

2..when to use props instead of state
   -when passing data as parameters into a component so that 
    it can use the data

   State = -
	   -anytime you need a component to maintain it's values

3..props are immutable
   state is mutable
