.........


React's primary task ? 

-Work with the DOM/browser to render UI to the page
-Manage State for us between render cycles (i.e state values are "remembered" from one to render to the next)
-Keep UI updated whenever state changes occur


What can't react handle on it's own ?

-(Out) Side effects! .... anything that leaves outside of reach
  -localStorage
  -Api/database interactions
  -Subscriptions(e.g web sockets)
  -syncing 2 different internal states together
  -Basically anything that React isn't in cahrge of
