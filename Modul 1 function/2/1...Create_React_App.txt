-set up a whole bundle of systems using webpack
-teach webpack config how to use babel so it'll take the react code and convert to something readable by browsers
-Babel and Webpack are not specific to React
-But react needs them for most web browsers

-But Babel and Webpack are difficult to use so we use "Create React App"
