.......Redux offers a way to fetch api's in a better way ............


we may continue from the previous projects 


Normally ....redux does everything synchronously , so anything happening asyncly has to happen outside the store ....



This is where we nee the redux-middleware 
the most common middleware is "REDUX THUNK" 


######....THUNKS ( a piece of code that does some delayed work).....#######
-Are recommended standard approach for writing async logic 
-Just the description of thunk in the bracket above does fit async task 




We will remove all our static state an now grabb data from an api
