....React Router .... 

-It's a library that enable building single page application with react


Advantage .... 
-Unlike a basic html website that we run to the server to reload the whole website every 
time we need to navigate to another page .....
  ....With React ....

Since The Whole react is runing on a single index.html 

React Router creates multiple pages so that you can navigate between then withou going to the server everytime 
(this means the side reloads only when you first open the side or submit a form ) 

-This make's the react app navigate very quickly like a mobile app  



Begin.........

npm install && npm start 



install this 
npm install react-router-dom@6
